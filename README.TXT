The Qt Motif extension assists the migration and recompilation 
of old Xt and Motif based applications to the more comfortable
Qt toolkit.

The latest (?) source release (Motif Extension v2.7) for Qt3/Qt4
is here further developed for Qt5-compatibility, display server
portability (porting away from X11 dependencies) and easier
re-compilation of existing Motif/Xt code without source 
modifications.
